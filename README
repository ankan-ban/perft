A move generater / perft tool by Ankan Banerjee

main purpose of this project is to understand/benchmark speeds of different move generation approaches.

14 Apr 2013: version 1: pseudo-legal 0x88 move generator. Runs at about 58 Million moves per second on 3GHz core 2 (single threaded)

15 Apr 2013: lookup table based move generation 
Added lookup table based move generation - currently only for sliding pieces (bishop, rook and queen). Unfortunately lookup table based move generation is marginally slower than pure 088 move generation.
+ some minor improvements in 088 move generator
current performance: 
~63.6 Mnps for 088 move generator
~56.9 Mnps for lookup table based move generator
